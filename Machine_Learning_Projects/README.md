# Machine Learning Portfolio

By Angel Gabriel Elias Diaz

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, ranging from foundational algorithm implementations to real-world applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems. Each project is organized into its own directory with detailed documentation and runnable code.

## Project List

### Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
A classic NLP task using Amazon product reviews to classify sentiments as positive or negative. It features bag-of-words representations, logistic regression, and perceptron models, along with grid search and cross-validation for optimization.

### MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification  
This project explores both traditional ML models and deep learning approaches for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes models like logistic regression and support vector machines, and builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch for superior accuracy.

### Matrix Completion for Recommendations  
A matrix completion project inspired by Netflix recommendations. It implements Expectation-Maximization (EM) with Gaussian Mixture Models and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to recover missing entries in a user-movie rating matrix.

### Core Machine Learning Projects  
This module contains notebook-based implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms using Python and scikit-learn. It‚Äôs ideal for learning and visualizing core ML concepts through clean, practical examples.

#### Notebooks Included:
- **Linear Regression**: Polynomial fits with Ridge and Lasso regularization  
- **Logistic Regression & KNN**: Binary classification with PCA and decision boundaries  
- **Support Vector Machine**: Linear/non-linear SVM with kernel tricks and grid search  
- **Decision Tree**: Drug prescription prediction and feature analysis  
- **Neural Networks**: MLP classifier with hyperparameter tuning and visualization
