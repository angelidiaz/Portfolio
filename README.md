# ðŸ’¼ Portfolio

By Angel Gabriel Elias Diaz

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of practical projects across machine learning and database systems. Each project reflects different stages of learning, experimentation, and real-world problem solving using modern tools and methodologies.

## ðŸ¤– [Machine Learning Projects](Machine_Learning_Projects)

This folder includes four major projects demonstrating the application of traditional and modern machine learning techniques:

### ðŸ”¹ [Sentiment Classifier](Machine_Learning_Projects/01_Amazon_Sentiment_Classifier)
A machine-learning-based approach to sentiment analysis using Amazon product reviews. Implements Perceptron and Logistic Regression with binary and count-based bag-of-words.

### ðŸ”¹ [Digit Recognizer](Machine_Learning_Projects/02_MNIST_Digit_Recognition)
Handwritten digit classification using both traditional classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.

### ðŸ”¹ [Matrix Completion System](Machine_Learning_Projects/03_Netflix_Matrix_Completion)
Predicts missing ratings in a Netflix-like user-movie matrix using Gaussian Mixture Models (EM) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS).

### ðŸ”¹ [Foundations of ML](Machine_Learning_Projects/04_Core_ML_Projects)
A notebook-based collection of basic machine learning algorithm implementations including Linear/Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

## ðŸ“Š  [SQL & Database Project](DataBases_SQL)

This directory showcases a collection of SQL and database projects that demonstrate practical data modeling, querying, and design skills using SQLite. It includes both coursework from [CS50's SQL course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/) and an original database project.

### CS50 SQL Projects:
- `01_querying.ipynb`: Cyberchase data â€” Retrieving specific episode information via SQL.
- `02_relating.ipynb`: Package tracking â€” Locating lost items using relational SQL queries.
- `03_writing.ipynb`: Cleaning and importing NASA meteorite data into SQLite.
- `04_viewing.ipynb`: AirBnB insights â€” Visualizing trends with SQL-defined views.

### [Personal Project â€“ Exchange Languages Database:](DataBases_SQL/Exchange_Languages)
Design of a relational database to support a language exchange platform. Schema includes:
- Users, Cities, and Languages
- Teaching and Learning relationships
- Friendship connections
